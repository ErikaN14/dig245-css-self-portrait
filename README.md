## Assigment


### Setup

[Fork](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vtK6LoqwF4rQQZZy-ovuEgsYUwwMRXsqDVMOjAPSBt0/edit#slide=id.gad119073e1_0_6) this repository and [clone](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1vtK6LoqwF4rQQZZy-ovuEgsYUwwMRXsqDVMOjAPSBt0/edit#slide=id.g9930d559e8_0_0) it to the `critical-web-design` folder on your machine.

### Design

1. Start by looking at examples for inspiration

- Art history [famous self-portraits](https://mymodernmet.com/famous-self-portraits/)
- Collections [Dribble flat characters](https://dribbble.com/search/flat%20characters), [@musketon](https://www.instagram.com/musketon/), [@thomcat23](https://www.instagram.com/thomcat23/), [@thomas_danthony](https://www.instagram.com/thomas_danthony/), [@vector.mob](https://www.instagram.com/vector.mob/), [@cecierlich](https://www.instagram.com/cecierlich/), [@owendaveydraws](https://www.instagram.com/owendaveydraws/), [@mister_fred_berlin](https://www.instagram.com/mister_fred_berlin/), [@nina_dzyvulska](https://www.instagram.com/nina_dzyvulska/), [@eezy](https://www.instagram.com/eezy/)
- Generative / deformations [Humaaans](https://www.humaaans.com/), Rafaël Rozendaal [Polychrome](https://www.instagram.com/p/ChcOtIDrWOw/?hl=en), [Dribbble Geometric patterns in graphic design](https://dribbble.com/stories/2020/11/11/simple-geometric-pattern-inspiration) David Lewandowski [Late for Meeting](https://vimeo.com/78424222)
- Internet Art [abstractbrowsing.net](http://www.abstractbrowsing.net), [species-in-pieces.com](http://species-in-pieces.com/), [Form Art](http://www.c3.hu/collection/form/), [Lorna Mills](https://www.instagram.com/lorna.mills/?hl=en)

2. Previsualize your layout by making sketches in [Figma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJK9NBGL5Bk). For example, try placing an image of yourself and tracing it with the shape tool, choosing colors as you do. (feel free to experiment an find your own method!)

### Code

1. Use HTML, CSS, and JS to code your design inside `index.html`
1. Use only hand-typed HTML and CSS for graphics; Do not add image or SVG files to the code. Do not use Figma to export code from your drawing.
1. Create those elements with HTML `<div>` tags
1. Use CSS properties to adjust the [background-color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/background-color), [position](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position), [height](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/height), [width](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/width), [z-index](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index), etc. of your elements
1. Also consider the CSS [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) property which lets you rotate, scale, skew, or translate elements
1. Use Javascript to display the current mouse `x`,`y` positions on the page (this will help with your layout practice).
1. Use Javascript to store and log the total number of HTML elements you used in your portrait using [`querySelectorAll()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll).
1. Add link(s) somewhere on the page to your original sketches in Figma.


### Publish

1. [Save and refresh](https://github.com/omundy/learn-computing/blob/main/topics-keyboard-shortcuts.md#web-development-edit-save-refresh-loop) your work in the browser often to see your changes.
1. Commit changes regularly.
1. Confirm valid [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) <sup>([?](https://github.com/omundy/dig245-critical-web-design/blob/main/topics/html-css/css.md#css-validation))</sup>
1. When finished, [push, publish, and post your project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17U_zmzM_eML_qkG0PaOdDRcEk3YEmbiQ1TyNnbAM08k/edit#bookmark=id.8jryplv1i8a)
